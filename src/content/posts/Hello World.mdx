Happy to see my site finally up and running. This space will be to share a bit of my work and experiences.Expect a lot of Javascript, and posts related to web development, data visualization and generative art!

My idea with this small project is start my self-development path to become a better writer, also share a bit of the projects I work on.

Thanks for read! If you have any sugestions or ideas, feel free to contact me to: me@carcruzcast.com

Pura vida!
