Happy to se my site finally up and running. This space will be to share a bit of my work and experiences. Expect a lot of software development related information and some of references of my personal life adventures.

My idea with this small project is start my self-development path to become a better writer, also share a bit of the projects I work on.

Expect a lot of Javascript, and posts related to web development, data visualization and generative art!  

Thanks for read! If you have any sugestions or ideas, feel free to contact me to: me@carcruzcast.com
