Hello!

Undoubtedly, the most important and radical change was taken in March when I
joined the [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/ 'Open Targets') team, part of the [Europan bioinformatics institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ 'Europan bioinformatics institute').
This opportunity was more than a change of employer, which in itself is a big
thing. Personal level, I moved from Costa Rica to the United Kingdom. On a
professional level, it was changing to a purely open-source project and in an
academic environment in which I had no previous experience other than
experimental projects with small teams.

The academic world prioritizes implementing improvements from an experimental
point of view, as far as possible and reasonable. Comming from being part of
companies where deliveries of new features and enhancements were a priority,
it is an impact after more than seven years of experience.

I have found that this has benefits. One of them is taking ownership of a
feature or project. And have time to research, validate and collaborate.
Another point, and I think it arises from the above mentioned, is what I
understand as technical debt. It is something that depends on how it is
received. Both ways, as an advantage or a disadvantage. Coming from deep
within the open-source web world, in the heyday of JQuery, BackboneJS, and
CoffeeScript, where we were thrilled with the Bootstrap 2.0 release. I detect
this as an opportunity to excel.

Nowadays, a lot of front-end projects in academics are developing with
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ 'ReactJS'). But most of them do not take all the advantages that the modern web
development ecosystem offers today. Frameworks such as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/ 'NextJS') or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ 'Gatsby').
Technologies related to stylings such as [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'Tailwindcss') or styled components. And
tools to improve code quality, such as linters, code-formatters, and testing
in the UI at all levels (unite tests, integration tests, and end-to-end
tests), do not take part in the scope of the projects. As a web developer in
the [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/ 'Open Targets') team, I feel comfortable having constant conversations
related to these topics, even more so with the openness to adopt this new and
robust implementation on the front-end.

Another not minor point is the learning that what you develop impacts
research. From my current position. In the use of data for systematic drug
target identification and prioritization. In this spectrum of bioinformatics,
there is much to collaborate on. Projects such as [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/ 'Uniprot'), [Chembl](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ 'Chembl'), and
[Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html 'Ensembl'), among others, would benefit from booming topics as data visualization
with server-side rendering and incremental static regeneration, design
centered on the user, and development tools such as monorepos and
micro-front-ends.

These months have given me a lot of perspective on what can be improved. I
develop a robust idea of the value of projects that operate with mostly
open-source code. Communities and multidisciplinary work are requirements to
improve, from the point of view of interfaces and user experience.

My goal in 2022 is to integrate some of these modern web concepts into the
[Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/ 'Open Targets') development model. From a more personal point of view, I am
interested in improving my stack of development tools. Technologies like
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ 'Svelte') and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/ 'SvelteKit') are attracting a lot of attention for the coming year.
Together with [Antonio Solano](https://www.antonio-solano.com/), I plan to upgrade a personal project developed
in 2015 called [VizGVar](https://www.carcruz.dev/projects/vizgvar 'VizGVar'). Our technology stack on the front-end will be [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ 'Svelte') +
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/ 'SvelteKit') with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'Tailwindcss'), probably hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/ 'Vercel'). It is an important
step, as it was around 2015 starting exploring [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ 'ReactJS').

My other two goals are a lot more out of my comfort zone as a front-end
developer. I am particularly interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ 'Rust'). It is a language that, in my
opinion, is positioned to be of importance in the coming years, if it is not
already. Also, that, as a JavaScript developer, I am excited to know that it
is 100% focused on memory efficiency. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ 'Rust') can lead to enforce complex
implementations in the browser. It will push us to create software that
improves the development experience abode any ecosystem.

Finally, and even further from my experience, I am interested in learning
about information design. As a software developer, it seems vital to me to
handle concepts on this subject. Today everything is related to data, and it
is a key to capturing or not the needs of the users.

Much to learn and much to explore. Time will give new challenges. With clear
objectives, it is easier to shape so many ideas and trends that surround us
today.

I will be more active in sharing my progress on this blog, and of course,
improving my site to add better ways to interact with me.
Thank you for reading!

As always, Pura Vida!
