NX4 is a web-based visualization tool for the exploration of aligned viral sequences. The tool was born as an alternative to matrix-based MSA visualizations.
This is an open- source project maintained by a small group of web-developers, visualization researchers and computational scientists.

I collaborated with researchers from Northeastern University and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

### Role

Web developer, including owning the Dev-Ops. My role was primarily to help build the visualization tool using modern web technologies and creating development and deployment processes and environments.

### Achievements

Published an [article in Oxford Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz457) about the application and its features
