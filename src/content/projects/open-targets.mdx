As Open Targets core maintainer, I have collaborated with the open-source community and a multidisciplinary team to develop software
that helps the systematic drug target identification and prioritization using genetics and genomics data.

More of my contributions are related to the Typescript/React-based [UI web applications](https://github.com/opentargets/ot-ui-apps) (development and maintenance). I have also gained
experience in back-end technologies, developing a production running API service using NodeJS, OpenAi, and Google Cloud. [OT-AI-API](https://github.com/opentargets/ot-ai-api)

### Role
